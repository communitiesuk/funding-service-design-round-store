This repo comes with a .pre-commit-config.yaml, if you wish to use this do
the following while in your virtual enviroment:

    pip install pre-commit black

    pre-commit install

Once the above is done you will have autoformatting and pep8 compliance built
into your workflow. You will be notified of any pep8 errors during commits.

In deploy.yml, there are three environment variables called users, spawn-rate and run-time. These are used 
to override the locust config if the performance tests need to run with different configs for round store.
